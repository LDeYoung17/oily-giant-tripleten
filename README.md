# Oily Giant Machine Learning Model

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project will predict the profits for the top 200 wells in a region that is most profitable for a mining company.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model using Bootstrapping (notebooks > ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) EDA: Evaluating relationships of well reserve characteristics through scatterplots
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Splitting and scaling data
        f) Calculating Profits - reserves necessary to break even
        g) Calculating Profits - choosing the best region based on the profits of the top 200 wells
        h) Calculating Profits - applying bootstrapping to calculate risk and profit for the top 200 wells of each region
        i) Project conclusion
