# Oily Giant Machine Learning Model

<h2>Summary</h2>

This project will predict the profits for the top 200 wells in a region that is most profitable for a mining company.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

1. Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model using Bootstrapping (notebooks > ML.ipynb)
      
        a) Project introduction
        b) Library and data importation
        c) Data preprocessing - finding and removing duplicate values, filling in missing values, etc.
        d) EDA: Evaluating relationships of well reserve characteristics through scatterplots
        e) Beginning of Machine Learning: Splitting and scaling data
        f) Calculating Profits - reserves necessary to break even
        g) Calculating Profits - choosing the best region based on the profits of the top 200 wells
        h) Calculating Profits - applying bootstrapping to calculate risk and profit for the top 200 wells of each region
        i) Project conclusion

<h2>Local Access</h2>

This project will require Python 3.9.13 or later.

All packages required can be installed from the requirements.txt file by executing the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To run the Jupyter notebook, it can be downloaded from the repository (the main branch) and run in the IDE of your choice that can accommodate.

Please note that the data that was originally provided by the client and is proprietary. It is not available in this repository for that reason.

<h2>Plans for updates</h2>

Update the commentary on the machine learning sections using the markup function to eliminate old and incorrect conclusions.
